This repository is for the paper named "How can artificial intelligence accelerate the circular economy transition from a micro-level: A machine learning based thematic review"
Abstract
This research explores how AI can improve the micro-level circular economy maturity. It is one of few that combines the machine learning algorithm and the thematic review. With this change in the methodology, this research has explored 601 articles and conference publications and categorised them into 8 clusters. That manual classification result is examined and modified by the machine learning algorithm to reduce the possible interference from researchersâ€™ subjectivity. In the end, this research brings out a new maturity model. Different from the traditional one, this new model not only maps the micro-level CE transition process but also shows three major dimensions that AI can contribute to this process: infrastructure development, information sharing and knowledge transferring / organisational learning.
